   TACTIC: EXECUTION (TA0002)

   TECHNIQUE: EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION (T1203)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: The use of well-known Microsoft Office exploits generated by exploitation frameworks is a common tactic. These exploits do not require zero-day vulnerabilities but instead rely on the fact that many systems remain unpatched against older, well-documented flaws.

   TECHNIQUE: INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER (T1105)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: The initial exploit is designed to load a small downloader, which then downloads additional malicious components (such as the Cobalt beacon) from an external server.

   TACTIC: COLLECTION (TA0009)

   TECHNIQUE: BROWSER SESSION HIJACKING (T1185)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: JS snifing (MageCarting) involves injecting malicious JavaScript into a website, often through compromised third-party services or direct website exploits. This allows attackers to intercept and steal payment card data directly from users interacting with the website.
