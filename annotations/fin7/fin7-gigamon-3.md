   > FIN7 used Cobalt Strike's DNS C2 as their method of maintaining access inside target environments

   SOURCE: TEXT

   TACTIC: COMMAND AND CONTROL (TA0011)

   TECHNIQUE: APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL (T1071)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: DNS (T1071.004)

   DESCRIPTION: DNS tunneling is used to establish and maintain a covert channel for C2 communication, evading traditional detection mechanisms that might monitor for suspicious IP traffic.

   TOOLS: COBALT STRIKE (S0154)

   SOURCE: TEXT

   TACTIC: COMMAND AND CONTROL (TA0011)

   TECHNIQUE: APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL (T1071)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: DNS (T1071.004)

   DESCRIPTION: DNS C2 uses legitimate-looking DNS traffic to communicate with the attacker's server. Queries containing data or commands are sent as DNS TXT (Text) or A (Address) resource records, making the traffic blend into normal DNS activity. This is effective in environments with restrictive firewalls, web filters, or proxies, such as POS networks in the retail or hospitality sectors, where DNS traffic is often allowed and less scrutinized.
