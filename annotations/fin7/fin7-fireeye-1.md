   TECHNIQUE: OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION (T1027)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: The use of encryption to protect the embedded payloads is a form of obfuscation, making it harder for analysts to understand or detect the malicious content without the correct decryption key.

   TECHNIQUE: PROCESS INJECTION (T1055)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: The malware is effectively injecting itself into the process. This allows the malware to execute within the context of a trusted application, making it harder to detect and more likely to bypass security controls.

   > BOOSTWRITE is a loader cra$ed to be launched via abuse of the DLL search order of applications which load the legitimate 'Dwrite.dll' provided by the Microso$ DirectX Typography Services. The application loads the 'gdi' library, which loads the 'gdiplus' library, which ultimately loads 'Dwrite'.

   TECHNIQUE: HIJACK EXECUTION FLOW (T1574)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING (T1574.001)

   DESCRIPTION: OOSTWRITE is crafted to exploit the DLL search order used by applications, specifically targeting those that load the Dwrite.dll (a legitimate Microsoft DirectX Typography Services DLL). The application follows a typical load order (gdi -> gdiplus -> Dwrite), and the attacker places a malicious Dwrite.dll in a directory that the application will search first, causing it to load the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.

   TACTIC: COMMAND AND CONTROL (TA0011)

   TECHNIQUE: APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL (T1071)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: WEB PROTOCOLS (T1071)

   DESCRIPTION: BOOSTWRITE communicates over the internet using a common protocol to connect to a hardcoded IP address and retrieve the decryption key and IV. This technique involves using standard web protocols to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server.

   TACTIC: DEFENSE EVASION (TA0005)

   TECHNIQUE: OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION (T1027)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: SOFTWARE PACKING (T1027.002)

   DESCRIPTION: The process of embedding and encrypting DLL payloads within the DWrite.dll file and then decrypting them using a custom key and IV retrieved from a remote server is similar to software packing. This technique is used to protect the payloads from detection until they are unpacked and executed.

   TECHNIQUE: OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION (T1027)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: COMPILE AFTER DELIVERY (T1027.004)

   DESCRIPTION: This technique covers instances where adversaries create or generate files at runtime, often with randomized or unpredictable names to evade detection or hinder analysis. The use of random file names can make it more difficult for defenders to identify and track malicious files.

   TACTIC: DEFENSE EVASION (TA0005)

   TECHNIQUE: DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION (T1140)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: BOOSTWRITE scans its own image to find and use a multi-XOR key to decode data within its body. The decoded data includes the IP address and port needed to retrieve the encryption key and IV. This technique involves deobfuscating or decoding files or data to extract useful information, such as decryption keys.

   TACTIC: COMMAND AND CONTROL (TA0011)

   TECHNIQUE: ENCRYPTED CHANNEL (T1573)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY (T1573.001)

   DESCRIPTION: BOOSTWRITE uses the ChaCha stream cipher, a symmetric encryption algorithm, to encrypt and decrypt the payloads. It retrieves a decryption key and an initialization vector (IV) from a remote server after connecting to a hardcoded IP address and port. This falls under the category of using symmetric cryptography for securing communications.

   TACTIC: DEFENSE EVASION (TA0005)

   TECHNIQUE: DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION (T1140)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: -

   DESCRIPTION: The malware decrypts embedded payloads using a key and IV, which falls under this technique. Decrypting and then loading a payload into memory without writing it to disk is a tactic to avoid detection by file-based security tools.

   TECHNIQUE: USER EXECUTION (T1204)

   SUB-TECHNIQUE: MALICIOUS FILE (T1204.002)

   DESCRIPTION: The downloaded and decrypted payloads are PE32.DLL files that are likely malicious. The malware performs sanity checks to ensure these files are intact and correct before proceeding to load them.
